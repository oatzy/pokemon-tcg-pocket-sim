# Pokemon TCG Pocket Simulation

Monte Carlo simulation of pulling rare cards from Pokemon TCG Pocket boosters.

The goal is to determine - for a given set of cards, how many packs would I need to open to either pull all the cards or have enough pack points to buy the ones I haven't pulled yet.

Currently it's hardcoded for pulling the "Champion of Sinnoh" secret mission cards from "Space Time Smackdown" Palkia boosters.
